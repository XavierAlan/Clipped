# Clipped

Clipped is a small daily web game where you guess a music video from a sequence of still frames, inspired by Framed.wtf but focused on music videos.

## Overview

- One music video per day for all players.
- Frames are revealed progressively after each wrong guess.
- Limited number of attempts to find the correct video.
- Built as a full‑stack learning and portfolio project.

## Tech stack (planned)

- Frontend: React / Next.js
- Backend: Node.js / Next.js API routes
- Deployment: Vercel
- Media preprocessing: FFmpeg (offline frame extraction)

## Status

- Environment created and first page deployed.
- Project overview and milestones in progress.
- Prototype and daily mode not implemented yet.

## Getting started

Project setup and run instructions will be added once the base Next.js app is created and pushed to this repository.
